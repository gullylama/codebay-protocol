# CodeBay Protocol

**CodeBay Protocol** is the third trust layer in the emerging agentic web. It provides a standardized method to certify that websites, APIs, and services are AI agent-ready, modular, licensed, and compliant with the emerging A2A and MCP protocols.

## 🧠 Purpose

To provide safety, trust, and modular certification in a world where AI agents act autonomously and require verified, structured, and trustworthy endpoints.
